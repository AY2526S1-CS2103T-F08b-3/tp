* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).

This is the team project repo for ConnectEd.

**`ConnectEd` is a desktop application for connecting students and tutors.**

We provide a one stop solution for tuition agencies to manage their database of the contacts of the students and tutors, allowing more efficient tutor-student matching.


* The project simulates a software project for a desktop application used for managing contact details of tutors and students.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[ConnectEd Product Website](https://ay2526s1-cs2103t-f08b-3.github.io/tp/)**.
